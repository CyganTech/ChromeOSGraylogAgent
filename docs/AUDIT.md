# ChromeOS Graylog Agent Extension Audit

## Summary
- **Scope.** Reviewed `extension/manifest.json` and `extension/service_worker.js` to understand permissions, data flow, configuration, and resiliency logic for the ChromeOS Graylog Agent extension.
- **Conclusion.** The service worker implements a policy-driven telemetry pipeline with strong input sanitization, bounded retries, and diagnostics. No critical defects were identified, but several medium-to-low risk improvements are recommended around manifest hardening, diagnostics ergonomics, and operational transparency.

## Functional Overview
1. **Install & startup flow.** The service worker seeds default settings, rehydrates configuration, and ensures collection/retry alarms whenever the extension installs, updates, or Chrome starts.【F:extension/service_worker.js†L31-L80】【F:extension/service_worker.js†L100-L144】
2. **Harvest cycle.** Every alarm tick, `scheduleLogHarvest` enforces single-flight execution, checks network availability, collects device attributes, runtime context, system diagnostics, and recent log artifacts, prunes empty sections, enforces a 512 KiB payload ceiling, and attempts immediate delivery to Graylog.【F:extension/service_worker.js†L146-L200】【F:extension/service_worker.js†L214-L357】【F:extension/service_worker.js†L1002-L1058】
3. **Delivery & retries.** Failed deliveries are enqueued with exponential backoff, bounded queue depth, and storage-aware trimming. Background alarms trigger retries until exhausted, and each significant transition emits diagnostics for administrators.【F:extension/service_worker.js†L520-L645】【F:extension/service_worker.js†L647-L715】
4. **Configuration model.** Managed and local configurations are merged with rigorous validation of hostnames, protocols, poll cadences, and manifest host-permission alignment before being cached for use by the pipeline.【F:extension/service_worker.js†L1078-L1216】【F:extension/service_worker.js†L1219-L1274】

## Strengths
- **Least-privilege manifest.** The manifest confines host access to the Graylog domain and only requests the ChromeOS-only APIs needed for diagnostics collection.【F:extension/manifest.json†L6-L27】
- **Concurrency safety.** Harvests track in-flight work and use a guard timer to prevent overlapping execution if a previous cycle stalls.【F:extension/service_worker.js†L146-L188】
- **Payload hygiene.** Empty sections are removed and oversized payloads are truncated deterministically before transmission, reducing delivery failures and protecting storage quotas.【F:extension/service_worker.js†L214-L357】【F:extension/service_worker.js†L1002-L1058】
- **Robust retry queue.** Delivery attempts are serialized, deduplicated, and capped by both length and estimated serialized size, preventing unbounded growth in `chrome.storage.local`.【F:extension/service_worker.js†L538-L645】
- **Diagnostic visibility.** All major failure modes (API errors, queue trimming, configuration issues) record structured diagnostics, with deduplication to minimize noise.【F:extension/service_worker.js†L214-L357】【F:extension/service_worker.js†L538-L645】【F:extension/service_worker.js†L1276-L1345】

## Findings & Recommendations

### 1. Manifest policy drift monitoring (Medium)
Managed policies can supply multiple Graylog hosts, but the manifest currently pins permissions to a single placeholder domain. When policy introduces additional hosts without a corresponding manifest update, they are silently filtered and only surfaced via diagnostics, delaying rollout troubleshooting.【F:extension/manifest.json†L15-L27】【F:extension/service_worker.js†L1123-L1158】  
**Recommendation.** Establish a release checklist (or automated test) that diffs policy allow-lists against `host_permissions`, or consider switching the manifest to organization-specific wildcards (e.g., `https://logs.<corp>.com/*`) before deployment so policy changes remain aligned.

### 2. Administrative tooling discoverability (Low)
The service worker exposes a helpful administrative messaging surface for diagnostics export and queue management, but the extension ships without an options page or UI to trigger these flows, forcing operators to rely on custom tooling or the Chrome debugger.【F:extension/service_worker.js†L850-L939】  
**Recommendation.** Document the messaging contract prominently (e.g., README, admin guide) or add a minimal options page so support teams can invoke `graylog:*` actions without bespoke scripts.

### 3. Diagnostic retention governance (Low)
While diagnostics are capped at 100 entries, they include device metadata (hostnames, serial numbers) and delivery context. The README mentions compliance considerations, but there is no automated purge or rotation strategy beyond manual commands.【F:extension/service_worker.js†L214-L357】【F:extension/service_worker.js†L1276-L1345】【F:README.md†L55-L89】  
**Recommendation.** Define retention policies (e.g., time-based pruning, periodic export-and-wipe) and communicate them to administrators to ensure stored diagnostics satisfy enterprise privacy requirements.

### 4. Payload truncation telemetry (Low)
Oversized log bundles are truncated before delivery, but the diagnostics emitted only record the final serialized size. Operations teams lack visibility into which sections were dropped or how often truncation happens.【F:extension/service_worker.js†L1002-L1058】  
**Recommendation.** Extend the `payload-truncated` diagnostic details with flags already set on the payload (`logArtifactsTruncated`, `payloadTruncated`) or add counters so Graylog dashboards can alert on frequent truncation events.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Align manifest host permissions with the full set of sanctioned Graylog endpoints before deployment and codify the validation in CI.
2. Publish or implement an admin-facing surface that can send the existing runtime messages for diagnostics management.
3. Formalize diagnostic retention expectations and automate cleanup where necessary.
4. Enhance truncation diagnostics to expose which payload sections were trimmed and the original vs. truncated size.
