# ChromeOS Graylog Agent Architecture

## Overview
The ChromeOS Graylog Agent is a managed Chrome extension designed to collect
ChromeOS device telemetry and system logs in managed environments. The agent
aggregates diagnostics data and forwards it to a centralized Graylog cluster
for long-term retention and analysis.

## Components

### Extension Service Worker
- **File**: `extension/service_worker.js`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Initialize alarms and storage defaults during installation.
  - Periodically trigger log collection routines.
  - Retrieve device metadata using enterprise APIs.
  - Invoke log collection helpers and forward payloads to Graylog.

### Logging Utilities
- **Directory**: `extension/logging/`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Provide adapters that interact with ChromeOS `logPrivate` and diagnostics
    APIs.
  - Normalize logs into GELF-compatible payloads for Graylog.
  - Handle batching, compression, and retry semantics (future work).

### Utilities
- **Directory**: `extension/utils/`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Shared helpers (configuration, error handling, metrics).
  - Chrome storage abstraction for policy-driven configuration overrides.

### Policy Templates
- **Planned Location**: `policies/`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Chrome enterprise policy templates to configure Graylog endpoint, device
    grouping, and log scopes.

## Data Flow
1. The service worker reads configuration from managed storage or local
   defaults.
2. Using Chrome enterprise APIs, the extension collects device identifiers and
   log bundles.
3. The payload is serialized in GELF format and transmitted to the Graylog
   server over HTTP(S) or UDP, depending on policy settings.
4. Delivery outcomes are persisted for troubleshooting and optionally surfaced
   in the admin console.

## Security Considerations
- Leverage Chrome enterprise policies to restrict deployment to managed
  devices only.
- Transport logs using mutually authenticated TLS where possible.
- Enforce strict schema validation to avoid leaking unintended data.
- Provide clear retention and redaction controls to satisfy compliance needs.

## Next Steps
- Implement log collectors leveraging `chrome.logPrivate` and
  `chrome.diagnostics`.  
- Add Graylog GELF payload builder with compression support.  
- Integrate with enterprise policy storage for centrally managed settings.  
- Develop integration tests and deployment documentation.
